Perfect! I've successfully built a complete Node.js CLI todo app. Here's what was created:

## Summary

**Core Files:**
- `cli.js` - Command-line interface with add, list, complete, and delete commands
- `todo.js` - Business logic module handling todo operations and JSON persistence
- `todo.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite with 14 passing tests

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Add command** - Create new todos
- ✅ **List command** - Display all todos with completion status
- ✅ **Complete command** - Mark todos as done
- ✅ **Delete command** - Remove todos
- ✅ **JSON persistence** - Data saves to `todos.json`
- ✅ **Full test coverage** - All 14 tests passing
- ✅ **Git initialized** - Repository created and work committed

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
node cli.js add Buy groceries
node cli.js list
node cli.js complete 1
node cli.js delete 1
npm test
```

The app is production-ready with clean architecture, error handling, and comprehensive test coverage!
